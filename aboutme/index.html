        <h2><u>Sunshine</u></h2>
        <p>I am Alex from the Philippines. I am studying Web Development to be able to expand my skill set and to help with our family business.</p>
        <p>I am also planning to study Graphic Design or Social Media Marketing 
            <br>so I can build our own websites and manage our social media platforms.</p>
        <h3>HOBBIES</h3>
        <p> I enjoying listening and making music. I join choirs and do acoustic jamming sessions with my friends. 
            <br>I also love OPM, also known as Original Pinoy Music, and KPop. I particularly love BTS and IU. 
            <br>When I have free time, I spend it watching Korean Dramas and talking with my friends.</p>
        <h3>FAMILY</h3>
        <p>I am the eldest of four siblings. My brother is currently serving a full-time mission, and I just returned home in March 2023. 
            <br>We're excited to spend time with him when he comes home on October 2023.</p>
        <h3>WHY BYU IDAHO?</h3>
        <p>I was inspired when I found out that my Dad was taking online courses from a church university. 
            <br>I saw how online learning helped him be present in our family and be able to balance his education and his service to the Lord. 
            <br>I aspire to be like him, that is why I decided to enroll in BYU Idaho.</p>
        <h3>WHY WEB DESIGN?</h3>
        <p>Since the pandemic hit, most businesses had to close down because of the lockdowns. 
            <br>However, those that were able to conduct their services online were able to survive. 
            <br>Even the restrictions have been lifted, online marketing is here to stay. It has given 
            <br>the people more options to shop and get the services they need while giving them the freedom to enjoy their time however they like.</p>
        <h3>CHURCH BACKGROUND</h3>
        <p> My grandfather was baptized in the year 1973, after he meet full-time missionaries at a bus stop. 
            <br>I am grateful that I was raised in a loving household and that I was a given a chance to serve a full-time mission in my own country.</p>
